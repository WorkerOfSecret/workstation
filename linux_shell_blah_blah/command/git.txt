    Reset worktree:
        git checkout HEAD .  
            # Will reset all the file and dir haven't been committed yet (those were edited, added, deleted), turn them to the original state

        git revert <commit num>
            # Will delete the commit in the log (useful when you want to delete the bad commit made in the past)
            # It doesn't actually delete the commit in the past(it will fix them - don't really understand),
