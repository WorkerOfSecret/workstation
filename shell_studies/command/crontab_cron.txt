On most systems, you must get permission from the system administrator 
before you can submit job requests to cron.


cron:

The cron daemon is a long-running process that excecutes commands at specific dates and times.
You can use this to schedule activities, either as one-time events or as recurring tasks.

for the cron daemon to execute.
##############


Options:
##############
$ crontab -a filename       Install filename as your crontab file. 
                            On many systems, this command is executed simply 
                            as crontab filename(i.e., without the -a option)

$ crontab -e                Edit your crontab file, or create one if it doesn't already exist

$ crontab -l                Display your crontab file

$ crontab -r                Remove your crontab file

$ crontab -v                Display the last time you edited your crontab file.
                            (This option is available on only a few systems.)

$ crontab -u user           Used in conjuction with other options, this option allows 
                            you to modify or view the crontab file of user. When available, 
                            only administrators can use this option.

Crontab File:
##############
    Consists of six fields, specifying in the following order:
        """
        minute(s) hour(s) day(s) month(s) weekday(s) command(s)
        """

    The fields are seperated by spaces or tabs. The first five are integer patterns and 
    the sixth is the command to execute. The following table briefly describes each of
    the fields are seperated by spaces or tabs.

Field       Value       Description
minute      0-59        The exact minute that the command sequence executes
hour        0-23        The hour of the day that the command sequence executes
day         1-31        The day of the month that the command sequence executes
month       1-12        The month of the year that the command sequence executes
weekday     0-6         The day of the week that the command sequence executes(Sunday=0, 
                                                                               Monday=1,
                                                                               Tuesday=2,
                                                                               and so forth)
command     Special     The complete sequence of commands to execute. The command string
                        must conform to Bourne shell syntax. Sommands, executables 
                        (such as scripts), or combinations are acceptable.
##############


Memo: 
##############
Each of the patterns from the first 5 fields may be:
    *(asterisk), meaning all legal values
    list of elements seperated by commas
        -> element can be a number or inclusive range, 
           indicated by two numbers separated by a minus sign(e.g.,10-12)
##############


Examples:
##############
Run program on the first and fifteenth of each month, as well as on every Monday:
    0 0 1,15 * 1 /mydir/myprogram

Run only on Mondays:
    0 0 * * 1 /mydir/myprogram
